# SurfApp
This app is for recording surfing locations. Users can create a "SurfSpot" where they record
different beaches and locations with relevant information about them. Users create a SurfSpot with a name, descriptions, warnings
and a picture of the spot where they went surfing. This could be of a simple beach where there is relatively little risk in surfing,
or where there is a walk down a cliff face into dangerous waters.

# Motivation
When trying to create an idea for an app that I felt was relevant, my
father told me a story about when him and a few of his friends piled their
surfboards into a van, and drove around the coast of Ireland searching for
beaches and waves to visit along the way. This gave me an idea to create an
app that could record the different places and beaches they could have visited
while traveling.


# Design
I decided to keep the app simple, as when a user could possibly go on a trip like this, simplicity and ease of use are more important then
complex features that would not be necessary for someone recording a surfing location.
The colour scheme of the app was kept simple, with a bright white background and a strong green for contrast and ease of use. 
Although blue might seem a more obvious choice for an app based around surfing, in practice the blue was harder to see and less comfortable 
on a white background then green. 
There is another factor with the colour green that motivated me to choose it over other design options. Green is rather a traditional
colour for surfers, as it is often considered the "lucky" colour when the colour are used to distinguish surfers during a surfing tournament.

## Cleanliness
I decided to change what the buttons and the fields looked like to the user. I moved the add placemark button further down, and made it smaller.
This makes it more clear that this button is for when the user has completed the surfspot to their liking, without them having to read exactly
what is written on every button.
The warning field is of a smaller text size and is placed directly under the picture. This helps the user connect the warning to the picture
in question, such as "Warning: Careful of slippery rocks" under a picture of a rocky shoreline.

# Future Features

## Login Functionality 
I would like to update this app with an account feature. This would serve the app in later updates, as I can then apply a specific SurfSpot 
with a specific user.

## Google Maps
A google maps feature would be a clear choice for an update. This would allow a user to attach a specific location along with the other options
for a surfspot. This also means that if a user is at a spot where they might not know the name of the location, they can still add it to google maps
to find out more information about the location.

## Sharing
Lastly, a sharing feature would be very useful for this app as a whole. Along with user accounts, and google maps, sharing surfspots between 
different users is possible. This would be very useful for surfers, as there is many small locations along the coast where only the locals
would know the location for otherwise excellent surfing spots. This last feature would complete the app, to a point where I could see this being published
on the google play store.
